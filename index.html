          <div class="card">To my favorite girl, <br><br>Hi, love! Happy Valentine's Day! I hope you enjoyed your day and my simple gift for you hihi. I look forward to celebrating many more valentine's day with you and hopefully di na virtual in the future hehe. <br><br>It has not been a while since we met, but I'm really at awe on how we just clicked and developed feelings for each other. It's amazing how we can just call each other without anything in mind what we're gonna talk about or do and still end up having so much fun everyday. It feels like in that short period of time we were able to build a beautiful relationship, something that I wouldn't trade for anything else. We went from being complete strangers to someone I can't go a day without talking to. Loving you feels like a dream, there's this peace that I have right now because I know I am loving the person that never fails to make me feel safe and loved and that pushes me to be a better person.<br><br>I just want to thank you for coming in to my life. Thank you for being my #1 cheerleader and for believing in me. You are the best support system because of the way you make me feel seen and understood every day. I want you to know that you are motivation in everything that I do right now because I want to give you not only the partner that you deserve but also our future life together where we can be genuinely happy. Thank you for all your efforts to make our relationship work even though it mostly costs you your sleeping time. I appreciate all the things that you do even the little things like the way you remember the smallest details about me, patiently reminding me the things that I forgot, and for making me laugh effortlessly. You are my source of happiness, and I cannot thank the universe enough for bringing you into my life. <br><br>You are not hard to love, Julienne. You are the most genuine person that I know. I love every version of you and that includes loving you even in your bad days. Now that I am here, you don't have to deal with things alone from now on. You can always come to me when you are having a bad day or when everthing feels heavy to carry. I am here to listen, to hold your hand, to wipe your tears, and to give you comforting hugs when life gets tough. I will always be by your side. <br><br>Happy Valentine's Day, love! I can't wait to be with you and share lots of memories together. I am excited of our future together and where will life take us. I just know that no matter what happen, as long as I'm with you, everything will be okay because you are my safe place, my home, and the love of my life. I love you, Julienne.<br><br><br>-Kamille
